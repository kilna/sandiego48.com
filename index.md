# What is the 48 Hour Film Project?

The 48 Hour Film Project *(sometimes casually and unofficially shortened to "the
48" or just "48")* is a worldwide timed film competition. Each year teams of
all skill levels, in over a hundred cities, compete making short films in a
weekend.

**The challenge of the competition is that each team is given a random genre.
In addition, all teams must integrate into their films a character name and
occupation, a line of dialog, and prop... none of which are known until the
competition kicks off!**

Some time after, completed movies are shown with a Hollywood-style premiere in a
theater packed with attendees. The audience picks an "Audience Choice" winner by
voting. Then, all on-time films are considered for film festival judging.

The best films are honored at the 48's own "Best Of San Diego" screening and
Academy Awards inspired ceremony, with many categories for recognition. The best
film in San Diego goes on to compete in the 48 Hour Film Project's Filmapalooza,
an international celebration and competition between city winners, with select
winners then shown at the Cannes Short Film Corner.

# When is This Year's 48?

This year's San Diego 48 Hour Film Project competition weekend will be Friday
July 12th to Sunday July 14th. You can register a team up until the day of
the competition for $178, but registration goes up on July 3rd.

# Screenings

Premiere screenings will take place August 6th through 8th.  The Best of San
Diego Gala, a combined showing of the best films from the premieres along
with Oscars-esque awards, will be Saturday August 24.
