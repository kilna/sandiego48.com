Come join us for our first Mixer / Meet & Greet event of 2025 in Miramar, at Ballast Point Brewing Company.

Whether you are in front of the camera or behind it... cast, crew, and helpers of all kinds have an opportunity to find and form teams before kickoff. Have a team already? Then this is an opportunity to network, to discover more talent, or simply hang out with like-minded 48ers and potential-48ers!

Even if youâ€™re only curious about film-making, we'd love to see you from 6-9pm on Tuesday May 20th, at [Ballast Point](https://www.ballastpoint.com/location/miramar).

## About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.

Team registration for the [San Diego 48 Hour Film Project](https://48hourfilm.com/sandiego) will open in just a few short weeks on Monday, June 9th.
