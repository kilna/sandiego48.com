First 2025 Mixer / Meet & Greet at Ballast Point

Come join us for our first Mixer / Meet & Greet event of 2025 in Miramar, at Ballast Point Brewing Company.

https://sandiego48.com/events/2025-05-20-first-mixer-ballast-point/

Whether you are in front of the camera or behind it... cast, crew, and helpers of all kinds have an opportunity to find and form teams before kickoff. Have a team already? Then this is an opportunity to network, to discover more talent, or simply hang out with like-minded 48ers and potential-48ers!

Even if youâ€™re only curious about film-making, we would love to have you!

Note: Ballast point is a child and dog friendly brewpub with non-beer drink options.

May 20th, 6-9pm

About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.

Team registration for the San Diego 48 Hour Film Project will open in just a few short weeks on Monday, June 9th.
