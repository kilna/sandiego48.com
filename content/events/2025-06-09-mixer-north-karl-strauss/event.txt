Whether you are in front of the camera or behind it... cast, crew, and helpers of all kinds have an opportunity to find and form teams before kickoff. Have a team already? Then this is an opportunity to network, to discover more talent, or simply hang out with like-minded 48ers and potential-48ers!

Even if youâ€™re only curious about film-making, we would love to have you!

Note: Karl Strauss is a child and dog friendly brewpub with non-beer drink options.

June 9th, 6-9pm
