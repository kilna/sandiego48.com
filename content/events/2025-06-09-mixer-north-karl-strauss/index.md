    ### About the 48 Hour Film Project

    The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make movies over a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.

    Team registration will open at midnight the night before the mixer, on Monday June 9th.

Whether you are in front of the camera or behind it... cast, crew, and helpers of all kinds have an opportunity to find and form teams before kickoff. Have a team already? Then this is an opportunity to network, to discover more talent, or simply hang out with like-minded 48ers and potential-48ers!

Even if you're only curious about film-making, we would love to see you from 6-9pm on Monday, June 9th at [Karl Strauss 4S Ranch](https://www.karlstrauss.com/location/4s-ranch/).
