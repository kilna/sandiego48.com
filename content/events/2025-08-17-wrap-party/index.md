    ### About the 48 Hour Film Project

    The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
    filmmaking competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make
    movies over a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San
    Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.
