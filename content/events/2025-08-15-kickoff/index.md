    ### About the 48 Hour Film Project

    The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
    filmmaking competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make
    movies over a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San
    Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.

The moment you've been waiting for is here! The 2025 San Diego 48 Hour Film
Project officially begins at Spark Studio Soundstage.

## I'm a team leader. What happens at kickoff?

You should get there around 4:30pm. You must be checked in by 5pm. Team leaders
must have their team leader agreements scanned, signed and uploaded to their
dashboard at [48hourfilm](https://48hourfilm.com).

Immediately after all teams are checked in, teams will begin selection of their
[random genres](https://www.48hourfilm.com/genres), one from each list, on our
wheel of genres.

Then leading up to 7pm, teams will receive:

* A random prop
* A random character name and occupation
* A random line of dialog

Then, the clock starts ticking!

## What if I don't have a team?

If you want to be absolutely sure to have a team, you'll need to
[create your own](/go/register)... but if you don't want to, come by and see if
there's a team looking for what you've got to offer! Actors, crew, production
and general helpers often find teams at kickoff!
