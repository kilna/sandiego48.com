    ### About the 48 Hour Film Project

    The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
    filmmaking competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world make
    movies over a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real theater. San
    Diego's competition takes place August 15-17th, 2025.

The San Diego 48 Hour Film Project will be having its 2025 open auditions
at Spark Studio Soundstage in Kearny Mesa this Sunday, July 20, 2025.

## If you are acting talent...

Please bring headshots if you have them, your contact information, and be
prepared to deliver a one minute monologue of your choosing from a favorite
play or movie script that showcases your talent. All skill levels are welcome.
Audition spots are first-come first-served, so please arrive promptly.

## If you are casting actors...

Be prepared to take notes, make contacts and have questions and direction for
actors that are relevant to the kind of films you may end up making for the 48.
For example, if your writing team's strengths are comedic, you may ask the actor
to repeat one of the lines of their monologue in that tone.

Even if you're only curious about film-making and what the casting process
looks like, come down and see what the 48 Hour Film Project is all about!
