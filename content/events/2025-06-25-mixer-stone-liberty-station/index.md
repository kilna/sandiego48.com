We're throwing a mixer and sync up in partnership with our friends at
[San Diego Media Pros](https://sdmediapros.org/)...  and we're bringing
experienced media industry veterans to talk one on one with you about how to
succeed in participating in the competition.

## Featured Mentors

* **Rich Varvale**: recording artist, filmmaker
* **Jeff Troeber**: broadcast journalist, producer/director, 48 Hour filmmaker
* **Brian Rose**: production expert

## Let's go!

Whether you are in front of the camera or behind it... cast, crew, and helpers
of all kinds have an opportunity to find and form teams before kickoff. Have a
team already? Then this is an opportunity to network, to discover more talent,
or simply hang out with like-minded 48ers and potential-48ers!

Even if you're only curious about film-making, we would love to see you from
5:30-9pm on Wednesday, June 25th at
[Stone Liberty Station](https://www.stonebrewing.com/visit/bistros/liberty-station).
