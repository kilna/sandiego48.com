Our last Mixer / Meet & Greet event will be just south of Downtown in Barrio
Logan.  Cast, crew, and helpers have one more opportunity to find and form
teams before kickoff; existing teams can network to discover more talent.
Even if you’re only curious about film-making, come down to see us from 6-9pm
on Tuesday July 9, at
[Mujeres Brew House](https://www.facebook.com/mujeresbrewhouse/)
and don’t forget that
[team registration for the San Diego 48 Hour Film Project](https://48hourfilm.com/sandiego)
is still open until the day of the competition.

## About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world
make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real cinema.
San Diego's competition takes place July 12-14, 2024.
