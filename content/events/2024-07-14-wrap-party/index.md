Celebrate the completion of your film with your team, and tell war stories to
your fellow film makers over food and drink. Join us at Novo Brazil in Mission
Valley when you've submitted your film on Sunday, July 14th.

We are working on exclusive swag for team leaders who perform the in-person
journey to share a beverage and a story with us!

## About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world
make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real cinema.
