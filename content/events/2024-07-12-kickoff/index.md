This event is the start for the San Diego 48 Hour Film Project weekend! Join us
at NTC Park in Liberty Station on Friday the 12th of July at 5pm to start your
filmmaking adventure.

There will be a food truck, [Taco Love](https://www.tacolovemobilecatering.com/)
where you can get... delicious tacos!

All teams must have their team leader agreements complete before checking in,
and all teams must have a representative in person.

After all the teams are checked in, each screening group's teams will pick
their 2 random genres for their films. Then through the evening, leading up to
the 7pm start, teams will find out the assigned elements:

* A random prop
* A random character name and occupation
* A random line of dialog

...all of which will not be known to participants prior to the start of the
competition.

## About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world
make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real cinema.
