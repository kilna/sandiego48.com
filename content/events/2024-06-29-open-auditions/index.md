The [San Diego 48 Hour Film Project](/) will be having its annual open auditions
at the Terrace Garden Room at the Handlery Hotel in Mission Valley this
Saturday, June 29 2024.

## If you are acting talent...

Please bring headshots if you have them, your contact information, and be
prepared to deliver a one minute monologue of your choosing from a favorite
play or movie script that showcases your talent. All skill levels are welcome.
Audition spots are first-come first-served.

## If you are casting actors...

Be prepared to take notes, make contacts and have questions and direction for
actors that are relavent to the kind of films you may end up making for the 48.
For example, if your writing team's strengths are comedic, you may ask the actor
to repeat one of the lines of their monologue in that tone.

## About the competition

The 48 Hour Film Project is the longest running and most popular timed
film-making competition. Amateur and professional teams around the world
make movies in a weekend, which are later given a premier in a real cinema.
