Spark Studio Soundstage in San Diego is a full-featured media production
suite, as a part of the Encore Event Center complex.  The versatile 3,000 sq ft
double-walled, sound-insulated TV studio in Kearny Mesa is the former XETV‑6
broadcast campus. Beyond serving film, TV, photography, and podcast productions,
it’s fully equipped with a 12′ green cyclorama, LED video wall, fog machine,
pro-level AV gear and club lighting, and can be reconfigured into a hall for
private performances, corporate functions, or cocktail receptions. The larger
campus spans over 50,000 sq ft of themed rooms—like a chapel, nightclub,
offices, classroom, and lounge; plus hybrid‑event capable upstairs space that
fits up to 550 people.
