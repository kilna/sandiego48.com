    <h3>Could you be a Team Leader?</h3>
    <p>Never made a short film before? Or... is IMDB brimming with movies you've
      made? In any case, <em>Perfect!</em></p>
    <p><strong>You</strong> can own the title
      "Director" or "Producer" if you have enough initiative. <em>The 48 welcomes
      all skill levels</em>, and provides a fun learning experience even for
      seasoned pros.</p>

        split the team costs with among themselves</li>
      <li>Movies shown in the 48 can be listed on IMDB!</li>
