<h2>What is the 48 Hour Film Project?</h2>

<div class="feature">
<p><strong>The 48 Hour Film Project</strong> is a creative sport fueled by a
love of film-making. Teams competete to <em>make a film in a weekend</em>,
exercising mental and physical endurance, and building lifelong friendships and
professional connections along the way.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes casually and unofficially shortened as <i>"The 48"</i>, it is the
world's most long-lived and popular timed film competition. Each year teams of
<em>all skill levels, ages and demographics</em>, in over a hundred cities
across the globe, compete to make a short film in just two days.</p>

<div class="feature feature-2">
<p>The weekend of the competition begins with each team assigned a <strong>random
movie genre</strong> by chance.</p>
<p>Additionally, all teams must include in their films:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character name and occupation</li>
<li>A line of dialog</li>
<li>A prop</li>
</ul>
<p align="right"><em>...and they only find out when the competition
starts!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Some time after, <em>completed movies are given a Hollywood-style
premiere</em> in a real movie theater packed with attendees. The audience
selects an Audience Choice winner by voting. Then, all on-time films are
considered for film festival judging.</p>

<p>The best films are honored at the 48's own "Best Of San Diego" screening and
Academy Awards inspired ceremony, with many categories for recognition. The
jury-awarded best film in San Diego goes on to compete in the 48 Hour Film
Project's Filmapalooza, an international celebration and competition between
city winners. Later, <em>select winners are shown at the Cannes Film Festival
(yes, <strong>that</strong> Cannes) Short Film Corner</em>.</p>
