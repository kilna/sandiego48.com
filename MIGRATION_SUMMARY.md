# Directory Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated film directories from old `dir` field to new `slug` field in `teams.csv`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Field Rename
- Changed `dir` field to `slug` in `data/teams.csv`
- Updated all team entries with new slug values

### 2. Directory Renaming
The following 5 directories were successfully renamed to remove the "the-" prefix:

| Old Directory Name | New Directory Name |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `2025-the-2880-minute-movie-makers-i-plead-the-fifth` | `2025-2880-minute-movie-makers-i-plead-the-fifth` |
| `2025-the-filmigos-fire-in-my-heart` | `2025-filmigos-fire-in-my-heart` |
| `2025-the-k-concern-tango-of-the-unseen` | `2025-k-concern-tango-of-the-unseen` |
| `2025-the-super-pas-dystopian-cowboys` | `2025-super-pas-dystopian-cowboys` |
| `2025-the-underdogs-crimson-hour` | `2025-underdogs-crimson-hour` |

### 3. Image Migration
- All images from old redirect directories were moved to new slug-based directories
- Old directories were completely removed since they're no longer needed
- Images are now properly organized in the new directory structure

### 4. Redirects Created
A `static/_redirects` file was created for production deployments (Netlify, etc.):

- `/films/the-2880-minute-movie-makers-i-plead-the-fifth` → `/films/2880-minute-movie-makers-i-plead-the-fifth`
- `/films/the-filmigos-fire-in-my-heart` → `/films/filmigos-fire-in-my-heart`
- `/films/the-k-concern-tango-of-the-unseen` → `/films/k-concern-tango-of-the-unseen`
- `/films/the-super-pas-dystopian-cowboys` → `/films/super-pas-dystopian-cowboys`
- `/films/the-underdogs-crimson-hour` → `/films/underdogs-crimson-hour`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `scripts/migrate-directories.py` - Migration script for future use
- `scripts/move-images.py` - Image migration script
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- `static/_redirects` - Production redirects configuration
- New renamed directories in `content/films/`

### Modified Files
- `Makefile` - Added `migrate-directories`, `move-images`, and `cleanup-redirects` targets
- `data/teams.csv` - Field renamed from `dir` to `slug`

## Usage

### Running the Migration
```bash
make migrate-directories
```

### Moving Images
```bash
make move-images
```

Or directly:
```bash
python3 scripts/move-images.py
```

### Cleanup (Future)
After a reasonable time period (e.g., 6 months), the redirects can be removed:

```bash
make cleanup-redirects
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Site Build**: Hugo builds successfully with the new structure  
✅ **Directory Structure**: All directories properly renamed  
✅ **Content Integrity**: All film content preserved and accessible  
✅ **Image Organization**: All images moved to new slug-based directories  
✅ **Redirects**: Production redirects configured via `_redirects` file  
✅ **Clean Structure**: Old redirect directories removed  

## Notes

- Most directories already had the correct names and didn't need renaming
- The migration script automatically detected which directories needed changes
- All old URLs will continue to work in production via the redirects file
- The migration is safe and can be run multiple times without issues
- Hugo development server doesn't process `_redirects` files, but they work in production
- Images are now properly organized in the new directory structure
- Old redirect directories have been completely removed for a clean structure

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All directories have been successfully migrated, images moved, and redirects are in place.

The migration has been completed successfully. The site builds without errors, all directories have been properly renamed, images are organized in the new structure, and production redirects are configured. Users accessing old URLs will be automatically redirected to the new locations.
